First of all, you need Windows 10 and an Admin account.

Got it? Nice.

There are 2 way a script(And faster way in my opinion) and a "hand made" way

Script way:

0. You need to download uplay-switcher-w-menu.bat from [here](https://github.com/mxswat/uplay-account-switcher/releases/download/1.0/uplay-account-switcher.zip) or you can directly clone the Git repo [mxswat/uplay-account-switcher/](https://github.com/mxswat/uplay-account-switcher/) 

1. Create a new local account (Must be done for every uPlay account)
2. Make it admin (it might not be necessary) (Must be done for every uPlay account)
3. Add the user where is written in the bat file
4. Run the bat file
5. Chose the profile 
6. Insert password if you have it
7. Log in with your second account credentials and 2FA (If not already Logged in)
8. Profit!

 "hand made" (I haven't tested it because I made the script at first) but in theory should work.

1. Create a new local account (Must be done for every uPlay account)
2. Make it admin (it might not be necessary) (Must be done for every uPlay account)
3. Now close your uPlay
4. Shift + right-click on the uPlay launcher and select "Run as different user"
5. Insert your new user name and if you have it the password 
6. Log in with your second account credentials and 2FA
7. Start R6
8. Profit!

In both cases: 

GG now you can use your second account with 2FA ON and you primary with 2FA without the need of login and logout every time

But WAIT! I lost my keyboard settings!

No panic, just copy the content of C:\\Users\\**YOUR\_MAIN\_WINDOWS\_ACCOUNT**\\Documents\\My Games\\Rainbow Six - Siege to C:\\Users\\**NEW\_ACCOUNT**\\Documents\\My Games\\Rainbow Six - Siege

I had a bug where I had to manually change my R6 Language to English

I hope this will help you, have a good day and...
